Graphene-IR-Spectrum V10
=========================

This version tries to correct what seems to be a bug in version 9.0,
which did not reproduce J(q,w) well.

Also, the approximation f(xi) - f(xi+eta hw) ~ -eta hw df/dxi will be removed,
at the cost of an improved scheme for Kramers-Kronig integration.
