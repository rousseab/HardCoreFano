Graphene-IR-Spectrum
====================

Computation of anomalous IR response of grafted graphene, within a tight-binding model 

This code implements the theory presented in the paper 

"Phonon-disorder valley scattering modulation of optical transparency in graphene" ( arXiv:1407.8141 )

The goal of the project is to compute the contribution to the optical conductivity of 
disordered graphene of the Feynman diagram presented in the paper.
