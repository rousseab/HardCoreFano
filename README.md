Graphene-IR-Spectrum V8
=======================

In this version, lifetimes are introduced in the Green functions, in an approximate
way, before doing the analytical continuation.

The goal of the project is to compute the contribution to the optical conductivity of 
disordered graphene of the Feynman diagram presented in the paper.
